    <h1>Instant Pot Chicken and Dumplings</h1>
    <img src="" alt="Chicken and Dumplings">
    <h2>Descrpiton:</h2>
    <p>  I wanted the richness of long-simmered chicken stew, but without the fuss of using a whole chicken.
       This compromise, using boneless skinless chicken thighs with bone-in chicken breast, gave me the richness of flavor and ease of preparation I was looking for!
        It's basically chicken pot pie made in a pressure cooker rather than an oven.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>½ tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>½ cup diced carrot</li>
    <li>½ cup diced celery</li>
    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
    <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon thyme (Optional)</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt (Optional)</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste (Optional)</li>
    <li>½ cup frozen petite peas</li>
    <li>½ cup frozen cut green beans</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Dumplings:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt (Optional)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
      <li>½ cup buttermilk</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Step 1</strong>
      <br>
      Pour the olive oil into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as an Instant Pot®) and select the Saute function.
      Cook onion, carrot, celery, and bay leaf until the vegetables are soft and the onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Step 2</strong>
    <br>
    Add chicken broth, chicken thighs, chicken breasts, thyme, marjoram, salt, and pepper.
    Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 9 minutes.
    Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
  <br>
  Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes.
  Carefully remove the chicken pieces with tongs and place them in a bowl to cool slightly; discard bay leaf.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Step 4</strong>
<br>
Mash butter with the flour to make a smooth paste; set aside.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Step 5</strong>
<br>
Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl for the dumplings. Cut in cold butter until mixture is the texture of cornmeal.
Stir in parsley and set aside.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Step 6</strong>
<br>
Shred cooled chicken and return to the pot.
Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning if needed.
Add peas and green beans. Stir in the flour-butter paste.
Select Saute function to bring broth back to a boil.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Step 7</strong>
  <br>
  Pour buttermilk into the dumpling mixture and stir until combined.
  Drop the dumpling dough by heaping spoonfuls on top of the stew; a small cookie scoop works well.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Step 8</strong>
  <br>
  Cover pot with the lid, leaving the steam vent open.
  Select Slow Cooker function and simmer on Low, covered, until dumplings are cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes.
  A skewer inserted in the center of a dumpling should come out clean.
</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3>Cook's Notes:</h3>
    <p>If you want to use this as a pot pie filling, decrease the chicken broth to 2 cups.
    <br>
    <br>
If you have a mini food processor, it's perfect for step 5. Transfer the flour-butter mixture to a bowl before proceeding.</p>
